GETUNZIPPED! is a simple, client-side web tool that lets you extract, preview, and download files from ZIP archives directly in your browser — no installation or server upload required (everything happens locally).

You just drag & drop or select a .zip file, and the app immediately shows you:
- The full list of files and folders inside the archive
- Ability to preview many file types (images, text, PDFs, etc.)
- Option to download individual files
- Button to download all contents as a new ZIP 
- A "Save to Folder" feature (works in Chromium-based browsers like Chrome/Edge) that lets you write the extracted files straight into a folder on your computer

It's a lightweight, privacy-friendly unzipper built for quick one-off tasks when you don't want to use desktop software or when you're on a machine without a built-in archive utility.
